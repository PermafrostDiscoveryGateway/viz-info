# Running the IWP workflow on Delta

The ice wedge polygons dataset is very large, so we use `ray` to run the workflow in parallel on the Delta server. Because this is not an NCEAS server, it is important to pay attention to how many Delta credits are being utilized as each allocation's funding is finite. 

## Steps:

1. ssh into the Delta server in VScode.

2.  Pull updates from `PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-workflow` repository [here](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-workflow/tree/main) to your home directory and switch into the `ray_workflow` branch.

3. Pull updates from the 3 PDG packages ([`viz-staging`](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-staging), [`viz-raster`](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-raster/tree/main), [`viz-3dtiles`](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-3dtiles)) and ensure you're in the main branch of each.

4. Create a virtual environment (recommended for root of env to be in `/scratch/username`) with `python=3.9` and install __local__ versions of the 3 PDG packages (using `pip install -e {LOCAL PACKAGE}`), `ray` with pip, and `glances`.
    - Changes integrated with pulls or saved manual changes will __automatically__ be implemented into that virtual environment if the local package was installed with `-e` (stands for "editable") and you are running a script from the terminal.
    - When the `ray` workflow and `parsl` workflows are finalized and designed as `poetry` packages, this manual creation of an environment won't be necessary because the `.toml` file will be present.

5. Prepare the `slurm` script to claim some worker nodes on which we will launch a job. By default, you are logged into the head node (login01, 02, or 03) which should __not__ be the node that executes the bulk of the computation (you actually cannot be charged money for this node). In the same terminal as before, run `squeue | grep {USERNAME}` (a `slurm` command) to display info about the jobs in the scheduling queue and which nodes each are running on. This list will be empty of you haven't launched any jobs yet. Then take a look at the script that will soon be run to claim the nodes: `viz-workflow/slurm/BEST-v2_gpu_ray.slurm`. (Rename this soon for clarity?) Note: lines at the top of this `slurm` script that start with `#SBATCH` are __not__ regular comments, they are settings. Other lines in the script that start with just `#` are regular comments. 
    - Look at the line `#SBATCH --nodes={NUMBER}` which represents the number of nodes that will process the IWP data. Increase this if desired, 5 is a good number with sufficient CPU usage, but for the last run Robyn used 10 because CPU usage was not efficient. 
    We are not sure how much increasing the nodes decreases the time. The most time-consuming workflow step during her run was geotiff creation. If the job time limit is nearing, it is important to `rsync` at intervals as geotiff files are written (such as 15 min intervals). 
    - **To ask Kastan: any tips for increasing CPU usage?**
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: Should we set up this rsync at regular intervals in advance of the workflow? Alternatively, could set up separate 24 hour job that starts at geotiff creation stage, so for example start job to run IWP staging and merging and 3d-tiling steps (and of course transfer all those files to /scratch), then start new slurm job to start at geotiff step to maximize time for low CPU usage.** 
    - Look at the line `#SBATCH --time=24:00:00` which represents the total amount of time a job is allowed to run (and charge credits based on minutes and cores) before it is halted. Decrease this if desired. This number of hours is multiplied by each node and the sum of all those values is the total number of CPU or GPU hours that is charged to your allocation. Do not use a full 24 hours if not needed, such as for an IWP test run on a small data sample.
    - Look at the line `#SBATCH --account={ACCOUNT NAME}` and enter the account name for the appropriate allocation. Note that our allocations come with GPU and CPU counterparts that are billed separately. We do __not__ store these private account names on GitHub, so pay attention to this line when you are pushing.
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: Kastan used GPU in our meeting cause we were running low on CPU hours, which should be used if we have ample hours of both?**
    - Find the `# global settings section` with the line `conda activate {ENVIRONMENT}`, and enter the name of your virtual environment for this workflow. This part will be hard-coded once we make this workflow into a package with a pre-configured environment in the `.toml` file.

6. Open a new terminal, start a `tmux` session, then activate your virtual environment. Switch into `viz-workflow/slurm` dir. (It's important to do this before ssh'ing into a node because we want the `tmux` session to persist regardless of the job's runtime.) Run `sbatch BEST-v2_gpu_ray.slurm` to launch the job on the number of nodes you specified within that file. At this point, credits are being charged to the allocation. The terminal will print something along the lines of "Submitted batch job #######", a unique ID for that job. This script writes the file `nodes_array.txt` that identifies the active nodes.
    - Can check active nodes by opening `nodes_array.txt`. Other team members' `nodes_array.txt` are saved to their local directory, and this file is not pushed to GitHub, so there will not be issues with your run.
    - Using `tmux` is helpful because it runs in a separate terminal in the background, which will continue the job even if the ssh connection to the server is lost. Best practice is to use the `tmux` feature to open multiple terminals at once with different panes so they are all visible in synchrony.

7. Sync the most recent footprints and IWP data files from `/scratch` to all relevant nodes' `/tmp` dirs on Delta: 
    - Open the file `viz-workflow/utilities/rsync_footprints_to_nodes.py` and check the filepaths in the `rsync` command are correct. Since Juliet is taking over this workflow, this will include syncing footprints from her scratch dir to the `/tmp` dirs on the nodes. Elias will put the footprints somewhere within `/scratch/bbou/julietcohen/` (exact filepath TBD)
    - In a new terminal, switch into the correct environment and run `python viz-workflow/utilities/rsync_footprints_to_nodes.py`.
    
    Overall, running this script is necessary to do before each job because at the end of the last job, the `/tmp` dirs on the active nodes are wiped. We do not just pull directly from the `/scratch` dir because the workflow runs much slower that way (a very low % CPU usage) since the `/scratch` dir is not directly on each node like the `/tmp` dirs are. Similarly, when we write files we do so to the `/tmp` dir then `rsync` them back to `/scratch` after to save time. This step is manually done, but one of our to-do's is to automate this step.

8. Continue to check the size of the `/tmp` dir in a separate terminal:
    - From the `/tmp` dir, you can run `ds staged_footprints -d0`. When the MB stops growing (usually just takes 5-10 min), you know the sync is complete.
    - Alternatively, you could run `find staged_footprints -type f | wc -l` and check when the number of files stops growing.
    
    Kastan and Robyn suggested that this step could be sped up a lot since the Delta server works faster moving a few large files than it does working with many small files. These files could be consolidated by "tarring" the files together before the transfer, then un-tar the files in the `/tmp` dir.

9. Adjust `viz-workflow/IN_PROGRESS_VIZ_WORKFLOW.py` as needed:
    - Change any hard-coded filepaths so they represent your username rather than Kastan's, and the desired subfolder you want for these files. Remember it is good practice to have the highest folder in the structure represent the date of the workflow run. I think a good approach is just to `cmd + f` "kastan" to locate the relevant paths (those that aren't commented out). Subfolders in the path will automatically be created if they do not already exist. These filepaths will soon be taken care of with improvements to this file that avoid hard-coding usernames and filepaths and rather using `subprocess` to pull that info in to apply to whatever user is running the workflow.
    - Within the `try:` part of the first function `main()`, there are a few lines that need to be commented out / uncommented out depending on your stage in the workflow:

    ```python
        try:
            ########## MAIN STEPS ##########
            print("Starting main...")
            
            # (optionally) Comment out steps you don't need üòÅ
            # todo: sync footprints to nodes.
            step0_staging()                                     # Good staging. Simple & reliable. 
            # todo: merge_staging()
            # step1_3d_tiles()
            
            # mem_testing = False        
            # if mem_testing:
            #     from pympler import tracker
            #     tr = tracker.SummaryTracker()
            #     tr.print_diff()
            #     step2_raster_highest(batch_size=100)                # rasterize highest Z level only 
            #     tr.print_diff()
            
            # args = 
            # step2_raster_highest(batch_size=100, cmd_line_args = args)                # rasterize highest Z level only 
            # step3_raster_lower(batch_size_geotiffs=100)         # rasterize all LOWER Z levels
            # step4_webtiles(batch_size_web_tiles=250)            # convert to web tiles.
    ```
    In the future, when we run the whole workflow from start to finish, this system of uncommenting steps and running manual steps or troublehooting errors in between won't be necessary, but this workflow cannot be run that way yet because it is not yet automated. The way the workflow is structured now:
    - The first step reminds you to manually run the script to `rsync` the footprints (already covered in an above step).
    - In the code chunk above, only uncomment the first step, `step0_staging()`, then save the script. _After_ we run this script and merge the staged files then transfer that consolidated `/tmp` dir to `/scratch`, _then_ we return to this script and uncomment the next steps. Kastan noted that steps 1-4 should run one after another but this has not happened yet due to errors.

As noted by Kastan and Robyn, this script could be improved by integrating the logging system Robyn utilizes in the PDG packages. These should be integrated __inside__ the `@ray.remote` functions. Another to-do! 

10. Adjust `viz-workflow/PRODUCTION_IWP_CONFIG.py` as needed:
    - With the new batch of data, the data path will need to be updated to Juliet's scratch dir. After this, the input path will rarely need to be changed (only if the IWP data pre-processing is updated and therefore new files have been transferred).
    - The output path will __always__ need to be changed, as we retain the outputs of past runs and do not overwrite them. Change the path following `/scratch/bbki/julietcohen`.
        - Even though we are using `bbou` credits, transfer the files to `bbki` because the latter is the allocation with unlimited credits gneerously provided by the Delta team. `/scratch/bbou` likely does not have enough storage space.
    - There is an opportunity for automation here: use an f-string for the dir name, with a variable that is the date pulled from the command line so it is always different than the last run.

11. Still within the `viz-workflow/slurm` dir, ssh into the head node associated with that job by running `ssh gpub059`. Recall that you are already in a `tmux` session, which you switched into before running the `sbatch` command to claim nodes. 

12. Run the script that we edited earlier to import the config, define all custom functions necessary for the workflow, and execute the uncommented step(s): `python viz-workflow/IN_PROGRESS_VIZ_WORKFLOW.py`. This will only run the staging step, on all nodes, since the staging step was the only one we uncommented in that script.
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: what's best practice for checking that staging step is done?**

13. Run `squeue | grep {USERNAME}` again to see the new job that has appeared at the top of the list.
    - This job may be momentarily noted that it is a `(Priority)` or something else within parenthesis that specifies why it has not been started. For example, it may show `(Resources)` which means the allocation's resources are already being utilized by other jobs. Check here for clues to troubleshoot an error in starting a job.
    - When there is no issue starting the job (there is nothing noted in parenthesis), there will be a node code such as `gpub059` that you will need to ssh into that specific node. If the number of nodes specified in the `slurm` script is greater than 1, then the code will show a __range__ of numbers for that one job, such as `gpub[059-060]`. The smallest number in this range is the "head node" for that job, meaning that is the number you will want to ssh into.
    - The current runtime for each job is also noted in this output, which helps you track how much time you have left to finish your job.

14. In a separate terminal, within your virtual environment, run `glances` to track memory usage and such as the script runs. This helps troubleshoot things like memory leaks. You can determine if issues are related to the network connection and `iowait`, or the code itself.
    - CPU usage should be at 100% for optimal performance, but it has fluctuated around 40% before, indicating a bottleneck. This could be the result of other users heavily utilziing the cluster you're working on, which slows down your processing but is out of your control if that is the reason.
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: do you need to add an additional step before running `glances` in order to only view the memory usage and such for this job?**

15. Once the staging step is done, adjust the file [merge_staged_vector_tiles.py](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-workflow/blob/8e68894b522faa619a4a7cb2dc2e10affc652c44/utilities/merge_staged_vector_tiles.py) as needed:
    - There are instructions at the top of this script ([`Usage Instructions in main()`](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-workflow/blob/8e68894b522faa619a4a7cb2dc2e10affc652c44/utilities/merge_staged_vector_tiles.py#L79)) to set the variables `RAY_ADDRESS`, `staged_dir_path_list`, and `merged_dir_path`.
    - **To ask for Robyn/Kastan: Do I set the `RAY_ADDRESS` variable as the instructions say or is that documentation outdated, and this step was already automated starting with [this line](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-workflow/blob/8e68894b522faa619a4a7cb2dc2e10affc652c44/utilities/merge_staged_vector_tiles.py#L52) through the next 2 lines?**
    - **To ask for Robyn/Kastan: When setting the ray address, do I need to change `dashboard_port`?**
    - Change hard-coded filepath for `BASE_DIR` [here](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-workflow/blob/0db036329c2046593983e5cd8450c9eb5c212b41/utilities/merge_staged_vector_tiles.py#L75) (should be changed to Juliet's `/scratch` dir, and the subdir that houses all subdirs for staged files on different nodes)
    - Change the hard-coded nodes specified in `staged_dir_paths_list` to the list of nodes you're using for this job.
    - Change the string part of `merged_dir_path` (where merged staged files will live) to the lowest number node of the nodes you're using. 
    - Remove this node from the `staged_dir_paths_list`
    - Run this script to consolidate all staged files to the node you specified. This script first defines the function `merge_all_staged_dirs()` [here](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/viz-workflow/blob/8e68894b522faa619a4a7cb2dc2e10affc652c44/utilities/merge_staged_vector_tiles.py#L132)), then executes it.
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: For the filepaths in this scripts, does it matter if they have a trailing `/`? Some do, some don't.**
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: What is best practice to know when this consolidation is complete?**

16. Return to the file `viz-workflow/IN_PROGRESS_VIZ_WORKFLOW.py` and comment out `step0_staging()` (because we just did that and merged the staged output), and uncomment out the next step: `step1_3d_tiles()`. Run `python viz-workflow/IN_PROGRESS_VIZ_WORKFLOW.py`.
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: What is best practice to know when this step is complete?**

17. After that step is complete, transfer all files from `/tmp` to `/scratch/bbki/julietcohen` using `rsync`.
    - Even though we are using `bbou` credits, transfer the files to `bbki` because the latter is the allocation with unlimited credits gneerously provided by the Delta team. `/scratch/bbou` likely does not have enough storage space.
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: Are the steps following staging executed on multiple nodes, like the stagiing was? If so, don't these files need to be consolidated before using rsync?**

18. Repeat for the rest of the steps in the workflow, and manually transfer the files from `/tmp` to `/scratch` in between each step. Pay attention to the 24 hours limit!
    - For raster files, utilize the script `/utilities/rsync_merge_raster_to_scratch.py`, and change hard-coded paths before runnning.
    - **To ask Robyn/Kastan: why is there not a similar script for transferring web tiles and 3d tiles? Seems to only be scripts set up for transferring staged and raster files.**

19. To purposefully cancel a job, run `scancel {JOB ID}`. The job ID can be found on the left column of the output from `squeue | grep {USERNAME}`. This closes all terminals related to that job, so no more credits are being used. This should be executed after all files are generated and moved off the node (from `/tmp` to the user's dir). Recall that the job will automatically be cancelled after 24 hours even if this command is not run.

20. Remember to remove the `{ACCOUNT NAME}` for the allocation in the slurm script before pushing to GitHub.
