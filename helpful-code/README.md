This "helpful-code" directory contains miscellaneous code files that are helpful when working with the PDG visualization workflow or portal

Contents:
- `update-PDG-portal.Rmd` contains functions to simplify finding, downloading, and updating a portal XML document for a given portal label. Note that it uses the deprecated `arcticdatautils` R package and should probably be updated to use `datapack` (See [datateam docs](https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/customizing-data-portals.html#updating-portals))
- `workflow.ipynb` contains code and documentation for executing staging, rasterization, and web tiling for a small input dataset (3 adjacent ice wedge polygon files) for all z-levels. Config anf logging is included, along with expected number of output files and time for each step.
