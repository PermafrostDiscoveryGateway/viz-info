### DARTS example
This example uses the [DARTS dataset](https://doi.org/10.18739/A22B8VD7C) to produce a layer of Retrogressive Thaw Slump coverage. 

### Set up
This [geopackage](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA22B8VD7C#urn%3Auuid%3Af1169dfd-0b3e-405f-9c56-4ff3c4827316) should be downloaded from the data package. 

It should then be placed in a folder titled `input`. The output of this processing is the DARTS RTS coverage layer that is on the production [PDG portal](https://permafrost.arcticdata.io/). In this case, we are only doing a couple zoom levels to not overload the server.
