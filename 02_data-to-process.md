# Data to process


The list of all layers that we are currently working on and plan to produce are in the [pdg-portal repo](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/pdg-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alayer). Each "layer" issue has notes on the location of the data and any processing that has been completed thus far.

There are also some layers listed in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Av6YQvXLjwdQxPb7-bQwrr7thX23O6v/edit#slide=id.p38) created at the beginning of the project.
