# Data to process

The two big layers that we want to produce first are:
1. The Ice Wedge Polygon layer ([Kastan](https://github.com/KastanDay) & Robyn will continue working on this one)
2. The Surface Water layer (at the stage of getting the data organized now)

Both of these layers are included in the list of all layers that we are currently working on or plan to produce, in the [pdg-portal repo](https://github.com/PermafrostDiscoveryGateway/pdg-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alayer). Each "layer" issue has notes on the location of the data, and any processing that has been completed thus far.

There are also some layers listed in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Av6YQvXLjwdQxPb7-bQwrr7thX23O6v/edit#slide=id.p38) created at the beginning of the project. Anna reviewed these recently and pointed out a couple of important ones that are now included in the pdg-portal repo list; the rest are low priority at this point.
